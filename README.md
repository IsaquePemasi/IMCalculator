BMI is recognized as an international standard for assessing the degree of overweight and obesity. It is calculated by dividing weight (in kg) by height squared (in metres).
<br>
<br>
BMI is the acronym for Body Mass Index, a parameter adopted by the World Health Organization to calculate the ideal weight of each person.
<br>
<br>
The index is calculated as follows: the patient's weight is divided by their height squared. An individual is said to have normal weight when the BMI result is between 18.5 and 24.9.
